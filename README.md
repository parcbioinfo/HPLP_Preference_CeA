Analysis scripts for the manuscript "Genomic and Behavioral Signatures of Selection for Ethanol Preference from the Heterogeneous Stock Collaborative Cross Mice â€“ The Central Nucleus of the Amygdala" currently under review. This includes all scripts used during the analysis of bulk and single-nuclei RNA sequencing data from the CeA of mice selectively bred to have high or low preference for ethanol in a 24-hour access, two-bottle choice paradigm.


For bulk RNA sequencing the raw data is available at the Gene Expression Omnibus at accession ID GSE288772: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE288772

For single-nuclei RNA sequencing the raw data is available at the Gene Expression Omnibus at accession ID GSE293636: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE293636


Annotation of scripts is ongoing.


Everything else is already present in the supplemental tables to be made available at the journal.

Feel free to reach out if there is any other data you are interested in please reach out to the corresponding author, Dr. Justin Anderson(andejust@ohsu.edu).
